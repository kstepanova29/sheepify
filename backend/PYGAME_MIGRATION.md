# pygame-Only Audio Backend Migration

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Compatibility**: Python 3.14+ and macOS  
**Date**: 2025-10-25

---

## Summary

The Fish Audio Python backend has been **completely refactored** to use only `pygame` for audio playback, removing all `playsound` dependencies. This resolves macOS externally-managed-environment issues and ensures full Python 3.14 compatibility.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **audio_player.py** - Complete Rewrite

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå All `playsound` imports and references
- ‚ùå Backend detection logic (`PLAYER_BACKEND`)
- ‚ùå Fallback logic between playsound and pygame

**Updated:**
- ‚úÖ Pure `pygame.mixer` implementation
- ‚úÖ Optimized mixer initialization: `pygame.mixer.init(frequency=44100, size=-16, channels=2, buffer=512)`
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup: `pygame.mixer.music.unload()` + `pygame.mixer.quit()`
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling for `pygame.error`
- ‚úÖ Better error messages when pygame is not available

**Key Functions (pygame-only now):**
```python
play_audio_from_url(url: str, cache: bool = True) -> None
play_local_audio(file_path: str) -> None
stop_audio() -> None
```

### 2. **requirements.txt** - Simplified Dependencies

**Before:**
```
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
playsound>=1.3.0    # ‚ùå REMOVED
pygame>=2.5.0
```

**After:**
```
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pygame>=2.5.0       # ‚úÖ ONLY audio backend
```

### 3. **README.md** - Updated Documentation

**Changes:**
- Added Python 3.14 compatibility banner
- Replaced all playsound references with pygame
- Added virtual environment setup instructions for macOS
- Updated troubleshooting section with venv guidance
- Removed "alternative backend" language (pygame is now the only option)

### 4. **ENV_SETUP.txt** - Enhanced Setup Guide

**New Content:**
- Virtual environment setup for macOS
- Explicit pygame installation instructions
- Note about externally-managed Python environments
- Compatibility statement

---

## Installation (macOS with Python 3.14)

### Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
cd backend/

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify pygame installation
python -c "import pygame; print(f'pygame {pygame.ver} installed')"
```

### Setup Fish Audio API Key

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env

# Add your API key
echo "FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=your-actual-key-here" > .env
```

### Test Everything

```bash
# Run all examples
python example_usage.py

# Or run specific example
python example_usage.py --example 1
```

## Benefits of pygame-Only Approach

‚úÖ **No More Dependency Conflicts**
- Single audio backend = simpler setup
- No "which backend am I using?" confusion
- Consistent behavior across all systems

‚úÖ **Python 3.14 Compatible**
- Works with externally-managed Python environments
- No `--break-system-packages` hacks needed
- Virtual environment recommended (but not required)

‚úÖ **Better macOS Support**
- pygame is well-maintained on macOS
- Reliable audio playback on Apple Silicon
- No system-level audio library conflicts

‚úÖ **More Reliable**
- pygame has better error handling
- Can stop/pause audio (playsound couldn't)
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

‚úÖ **Future-Proof**
- pygame actively maintained (playsound is deprecated)
- Better documentation and community support
- More features available if needed later

---

## API Compatibility

**No breaking changes to public API!** All functions work exactly the same:

```python
from services import fish_audio_service, audio_player

# Generate speech (unchanged)
result = fish_audio_service.generate_speech(
    text="Wake up, sleepy sheep!",
    speed=1.0,
    emotion="excited"
)

# Play audio (unchanged - still works the same way)
audio_player.play_audio_from_url(result['audio_url'])

# Stop audio (now actually works properly!)
audio_player.stop_audio()
```

**example_usage.py** requires **zero changes** and still works perfectly!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "pygame not available" Error

**Solution 1: Use virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pygame
```

**Solution 2: Install with homebrew**
```bash
brew install python-pygame
```

**Solution 3: User-level install**
```bash
pip install --user pygame
```

### Audio Playback Fails

**Check pygame installation:**
```bash
python -c "import pygame; pygame.mixer.init(); print('‚úì pygame audio working')"
```

**Check system audio:**
- Verify system volume is not muted
- Test with other audio applications
- Check audio output device is selected

### Import Errors

**Make sure you're in the virtual environment:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # You should see (venv) in your prompt
python example_usage.py
```

## Verification Checklist

After upgrading, verify everything works:

- [ ] pygame imports successfully: `python -c "import pygame; print('OK')"`
- [ ] Audio player functions work: `python -c "from services import audio_player; print('OK')"`
- [ ] Example script runs: `python example_usage.py --example 1`
- [ ] Cache functions work: `python -c "from services import audio_player; print(audio_player.get_cache_size())"`
- [ ] Stop function works: Test interrupting audio playback
- [ ] No playsound references in code: `grep -r "playsound" backend/services/`

---

## Migration for Existing Users

If you previously had playsound installed:

```bash
# 1. Activate your environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Uninstall playsound (optional, won't hurt to keep it)
pip uninstall playsound -y

# 3. Ensure pygame is installed
pip install pygame>=2.5.0

# 4. Test
python example_usage.py
```

---

## Next Steps

Now that the backend is Python 3.14 + macOS compatible:

1. ‚úÖ Test all examples work
2. ‚úÖ Verify audio playback quality
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Integrate with Flask/FastAPI endpoints
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Add to Sheepify mobile app backend
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Deploy to production

---

## Support

**Issues?**
- Check `backend/README.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- Verify pygame version: `pip show pygame`
- Test pygame directly: `python -c "import pygame; pygame.mixer.init()"`

**Questions?**
- See examples in `example_usage.py`
- Check inline documentation in `audio_player.py`
- Review `ENV_SETUP.txt` for setup guidance

**Migration completed successfully!** üéâ

The Fish Audio backend is now fully compatible with Python 3.14 and modern macOS systems.

To do:
1. bruh you moved the sun up instead of down...
2. The textbox around Shepherd's farm should be cloud shaped! refer to cloud.png for what i want. all you did last time was make it bigger
3. I want only the block of dirt platform and the dark background. nothing else. Get rid of the weird whatever brown boc you currently have and the tree. Also i deleted the backgorund on the original png so update that as well. Finally make the platform bigger

To-do:
1. Make the head bigger
2. I want the LLM to be implemented in the following manner:
- a new message is generated every time the head is pressed
- the first message of the day will be a "dream message" which you should be aware the implementation and idea b ehind
- subsequent message will be a randomly generated message. good sleep will lead to a compliment or a pickup line, both utilising sheep puns and bad sleep will lead to a roast with a sheep pun
- the message should not be longer than 3 lines in the text box.

The method for finding the green area and contours should be the same; dont change it. the sheep should ONLY spawn in that certain area. Just change the windmill!

Then implement the windmill animation again. For your convenience I have added farm+windmill-1 and 2.tiff as the 2 frames. The animation should change twice a second.

Sheep should not spawn ON THE WINDMILL
